Waiting for the Emmys. BTW did you know won 6 <span class="test__measure">Emmys and was still canceled e</span>arly by Fox? COME ON. No one's called him Baby Buster since high school. A trick is something a whore does for money…or candy. … or cocaine. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants.

One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it. You'd do that to your own brother? I said "cot." Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one.

Bob Loblaw Law Blog. There's a girl in my soup! It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it! Do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi.
